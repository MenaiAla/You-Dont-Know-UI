  <h1>You Don't Know UI</h1>
  <h3>You don't need to be a 10X designer to create universal user interfaces</h3>

---

<span>Inspired by [KYLE SIMPSON](https://github.com/getify)'s book [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), I decided to create [You Don't Know UI](https://github.com/You-Dont-Know-UI) which is a DESIGN PRO TIPS dedicated for developers to learn, discuss, contribute together and share the best practices about designing user interfaces.

Back to 2017, I started to spent my spare time to learn in-depth about Web Design, Mobile Design, Animation, Micro-Interaction, User Experience and Design Systems by reading several books and articles such as [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/) by [Adam Wathan](https://github.com/adamwathan) & [Steve Shoger](https://www.steveschoger.com/), [Invision Design System Handbook](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook), [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) by [Brad Frod](https://github.com/bradfrost), [Airbnb Design System](https://github.com/airbnb), asking questions on [User Experience Platform](https://ux.stackexchange.com/), and sharing my personal [prototypes](https://www.behance.net/menaialaeddine) on Behance. Also, I started sharing these Tips 2 months ago on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alaedddine/) but they are not professional and more detailed like here.


From basic to advanced: test how well your UI is modern, consistent, universal, and accessible, refresh your workflow a bit, or enhance the product you're working on! :muscle: :rocket: I update this repo regularly with new PRO TIPS. I added examples to make the explanations more tangible. good luck! :heart:</span>

<details><summary><b>1. Think in a feature, not a layout</b></summary>
<p>

I've wasted months not just days trying to create an MVP ( Minimal  Viable Product ) for an idea. I spent nights and nights refactoring the user interfaces by changing just the places of the components and the layouts. Don't be stupid like me!

When you start designing a new user interface for a web or mobile application, most of the time you think about the **structure** or the **position** of your components, so you start designing the Header or the Top Navigation as your first component in your UI. Me too I was doing this mistake!

<img src="./assets/PRO_TIP_1_3.svg" width="100%"/>

Do you know why it's a mistake? Because you're limiting yourself from the beginning. Because you're seeing the App Design from Top-To-Down or Down-To-Top while the App Design is a **collection of features**. You're not building a house here using LEGO bricks! But you're building a car and you can start designing the engine or the wheels, right?

Most of the folks try to _copy & paste_ from popular websites and apps, without knowing the Standards or the Design Decisions for each product. This is the easiest way to find themselves _frustrated_, _limited_ and they figure out that they overthink only on _Generic Things_.

They focus on the _shape_ of their app but not the _core features_, and they start asking frequently these questions :

<i> <img src="./icons/icons8_confusion_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Where should I put the Logo?</i>

<i> <img src="./icons/icons8_confusion_24px.png" width="16px"/>   How many items should I have in the navigation bar? </i>

<i> <img src="./icons/icons8_confusion_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Should I have one or two sidebars?</i>

<i> <img src="./icons/icons8_confusion_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Should I have a Grid Layout or a Table of items?</i>

<img src="./assets/PRO_TIP_1_1.svg" width="100%"/>

But, what you don't know ( maybe ) is UI Components are made to solve certain problems that's related to _user interaction_, _data displaying_ or _new device screen invention_, and you may be noticed that _Humburger_ element is started to be well-known in mobile devices.
 
Obviously, we are not designing user interfaces but we are designing and implementing features, and Top Navigation is just a _common feature_ that helps users to do quick navigation for certain and most important pages.

So, don't care about common features or what I call them _Generic features_ or _layouts_.

Instead of starting by a _layout_, start with a _feature_ or a _specific functionality_ , and not any _feature_ but the _core feature_ in your product.

Let's say you'll build the next-gen social media app for sharing videos. You could start with this **core feature** : Share a short-form video.

The UI will need :

<i><img src="./icons/icons8_checkmark_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Field for upload a video</i>

<i><img src="./icons/icons8_checkmark_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Field for the caption</i>

<i><img src="./icons/icons8_checkmark_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Field for the description</i>

<i><img src="./icons/icons8_checkmark_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Button for posting or sharing</i>

<i><img src="./icons/icons8_checkmark_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Button for saving in draft</i>

These are the requirements to design your UI.

<details><summary><b>2. Design few, Implement few, Repeat</b></summary>
<p>
I have this question for you:

<i> <img src="./icons/icons8_confusion_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Why do you need to design perfect UI with all details then implement it?</i>

I have another question for you:


<i> <img src="./icons/icons8_confusion_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Did you feel frustrated in the stage of implementation of a new feature because the design does not take programming limits in consideration?</i>

My last question is:

<i> <img src="./icons/icons8_confusion_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Why do you focus on details in the early stage of the design?</i>

Ha! I know you're thinking in Agile but you're working with the Waterfall approach.

Indeed, people get confused when they switch from task to other per day even in the same domain, it happened to me usually, especially when it comes to designing different concepts of user interfaces per day.

Furthermore, people want to start a thing and finish it once time. They want to make it perfect from the beginning! Even with **low resource** and in **limited time**. It happens most of the time in early-stage **startups**.

So, let me tell you something: **Details do not matter when you start from scratch.**

The hard thing about the design is when someone asks you: Why you take this decision?

<i> <img src="./icons/icons8_confusion_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Why you chose this palette of colors?</i>

<i> <img src="./icons/icons8_confusion_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Why you chose this typface?</i>

<i> <img src="./icons/icons8_confusion_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Why you chose this style of icons?</i>

If you have not a Design System in place, creating **consistent** user interfaces is very hard, and focusing in-depth on **details**, will lose **time**, **effort**, and of course the **consistency** of your user interfaces.

<img src="./assets/PRO_TIP_2_1.svg"/>

So, what's the solution here?

As I mentioned in the title: **Design few, Implement few, Repeat.**

In the earliest stage of the new design or new feature, you don't need to stick on the **high-level** decisions about the foundation of your design ( Spacing, Color, Typography, Iconography). I know they matter but not in the beginning, right?

Let's say, when you were having a shower you came up with an idea for a new killer feature, and you want to make it more tangible for your teammates and the stakeholders to get buy-in. Adding new features means a new investment of money and time and what's matter later for any company is: **Revenue**.

The first thing, you need to do is ignore all details ( nice-to-have ) and just focus on the requirements ( must-to-have ).

So, I recommend this workflow to get quick both of **internal** and **external** feedback:

<img src="./icons/icons8_1_key_24px.png" width="16px"/>  Create hand-drawn version.

<img src="./assets/PRO_TIP_2_2.svg"/>

As you see here, there are zero details about your user interface in production, but why this step matters?

This hand-drawn activity may take between 5min and 20mins if you want to make it **high-fidelity** draw! 

In fact, this step will help you to see other teammates and stakeholder's opinions and gather  **individual recommendations** from each member in your team. People could not recommend changes when they see a well-done thing. But they can tell you how can you make it better when you deliver it **clean** but **uncomplete** and **ugly**. It's human nature.


<img src="./icons/icons8_2_key_24px.png" width="16px"/>   Ignore colors.

<img src="./assets/PRO_TIP_2_3.svg"/>

When I was a kid, I remember my Dad when he was buying a paint book for me. The content was grayscale images and my mission was to colorize these images using wood colors. Sometimes, I and my friend have the same image but when we colorize we end up with different looks! After that, we go to family members and ask them which one is better.

But how can we adopt this workflow in our design?

The idea is to **hold the color** even if you'll refine your design in higher fidelity. Let people tell you how are the **shapes**, **sizes**, **spaces** and the **position** of your elements.

<img src="./icons/icons8_3_key_24px.png" width="16px"/>  Implement the UI.

Modern frameworks and libraries such as [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) were created for **Rapid Prototyping** which means you can implement one component and use it with **different looks** in **different positions**. So, you don't need to have a **full prototype** with all user interfaces to start the implementation.

It's a little bit challenging, but I can say that you don't need to regret the time you spent for designing **perfect UI** that you'll never see it on production.

The goal of this step is to test the **back functionality** ( How it works ) of the UI without sticking on how it looks for users.

<img src="./icons/icons8_4_key_24px.png" width="16px"/>  Colorize.

If you don't have a color palette in place, you can try several colors and see the consistency between them based on color theory rules.


<img src="./assets/PRO_TIP_1_2.svg"/>


<img src="./icons/icons8_5_key_24px.png" width="16px"/>  Repeat.

Our purpose here is to prevent the **over investing** and moving fast by doing **parallel iterations** on both design and code in **short time**, so you can build real thing as soon as possible. In the end, what matters is your UI in production.
